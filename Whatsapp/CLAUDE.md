## Platform Support

- iOS
- Android  
- Web (via Expo Web)

## Authentication Setup

This project uses **Clerk** for complete authentication management.

### Current Features:
- Email/password registration with email verification
- 6-digit email verification codes
- Sign-in/sign-out functionality
- Protected routes with automatic redirects
- Session management and token caching
- Loading states and error handling

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Welcome Screen** â†’ Choose sign up or sign in
2. **Sign Up** â†’ Email/password â†’ Email verification â†’ Home
3. **Sign In** â†’ Email/password â†’ Home
4. **Protected Routes** â†’ Automatic redirect based on auth state

### Architecture:
- **Authentication**: Clerk with email/password strategy
- **State Management**: Clerk's built-in auth state + React Context
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with file-based routing
- **Route Protection**: Layout-based auth guards
- **Session Persistence**: Clerk token cache
- **UI Components**: Custom WhatsApp-style components

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features:
- Complete authentication system (Clerk integration)
- Welcome screen with WhatsApp-style UI
- Email registration with verification
- Sign-in/sign-out functionality
- Protected route system
- Error handling and loading states
- Navigation with gesture support
- Custom UI components and theming

### ðŸš§ Next Steps:
- Messaging system implementation
- Contacts management
- Chat interface
- Real-time messaging
- Media sharing
- Voice/video calls
- Push notifications

## Technical Notes

- Uses Expo managed workflow (~53.0.22)
- React Native 0.79.5 with React 19.0.0
- Compatible with Expo Go for development testing  
- Supports over-the-air updates via Expo Updates
- TypeScript enabled with strict mode
- ESLint configured for code quality
- New React Native architecture enabled

# Agent Integration & Documentation

## Code Documentation Agent
This project has a specialized `code-documenter` agent that MUST be used automatically after every significant code change. The agent is located at `.claude/agents/code-documenter.md`.

### Agent Usage Rules:
- **AUTOMATICALLY** use the code-documenter agent after implementing new features
- **AUTOMATICALLY** use the code-documenter agent after refactoring existing code  
- **AUTOMATICALLY** use the code-documenter agent after architectural changes
- **AUTOMATICALLY** use the code-documenter agent after adding new components

### Implementation Workflow:
1. Complete the requested code changes
2. **IMMEDIATELY** invoke the code-documenter agent using the Task tool
3. Provide comprehensive documentation explaining:
   - What was changed and why
   - How the implementation works
   - Integration points with existing code
   - Testing considerations and next steps

This ensures every development session maintains a complete, educational record of all changes made to the WhatsApp clone project.

# Important Instructions

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
**ALWAYS** use the code-documenter agent after completing significant code changes.
